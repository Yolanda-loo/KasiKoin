KasiKoin — 5-slide Hackathon Deck (refined)

Slide 1 — Title & Hook (Visual: bold hero image)
- Title: KasiKoin — Stable Payments for Township Creators
- One-liner: "ZAR-pegged, mobile-first payments that unlock income for the kasi."
- Visual cue: portrait of a creator scanning a QR; township textile pattern border.
- Speaker note: Start with a 10s micro-story: "Lerato, a 22‑year‑old tutor in Soweto, just got paid instantly from a learner in Cape Town — no bank needed."

Slide 2 — The Problem (Visual: statistics + icon row)
- Three bullets (one line each):
  1) Unstable income + 5–10% fees on remittances and platforms
  2) >20% unbanked; many on feature phones or low-data plans
  3) Trust gaps with cash, no easy escrow for local gigs
- Visual cue: icons for volatility, phone, and cash
- Speaker note: Tie each bullet to a real harm: missed meals, lost gigs, and trust breakdown.

Slide 3 — Our Solution (Visual: simplified architecture)
- Core offerings (short):
  • ZAR‑pegged KASI token on Celo (mobile-first)
  • QR + SMS wallets, multilingual agent Thando
  • Milestone escrow, NFT minting, local agent cash-outs
- Visual cue: flow diagram: Buyer -> Agent/Phone -> Blockchain (KASI) -> Creator -> IPFS (content)
- Speaker note: Emphasize accessibility (SMS) and trust (escrow + agents).

Slide 4 — Product demo (Visual: 3 micro-screens)
- Micro-flows:
  1) Tip: scan QR -> confirm -> instant KASI to creator (0.01 ZAR-equivalent fee)
  2) Sell digital: pay KASI -> receive IPFS link + optional NFT
  3) Withdraw: request -> get OTB code -> collect ZAR from agent
- Visual cue: three phone mockups showing each flow; show small tx fee badge.
- Speaker note: Narrate one quick example end-to-end (QR tip to tutorial PDF NFT).

Slide 5 — Impact, traction & ask (Visual: KPI tiles + CTA)
- Impact targets:
  • Pilot: 500 creators, 2,000 tx/month in 6 months
  • Fees: target <0.5% on-platform; instant settlement
  • Inclusion: accessible for feature phones and disabled users
- Ask: $50k pilot funding, agent partners in Soweto, regulatory & KYC mentorship
- CTA: "Partner with us to pilot KasiKoin — stabilise earnings, preserve culture, sell globally."
