Subject: Pilot partnership — KasiKoin (mobile stablecoin for township creators)

Hi [Partner name],

We’re building KasiKoin: a mobile-first, ZAR-pegged stablecoin and payments platform to help township creators (tutors, artists, cooks) earn reliably and access low-fee digital payments.

Why this matters
- Many creators in townships are unbanked, face volatile income, and pay high fees to receive payments.
- KasiKoin uses low-cost blockchain settlement (Celo), QR & SMS wallets, and a trusted agent cash-out model so creators can be paid instantly and withdraw in ZAR.

Pilot scope
- Target: 500 creators in Soweto, 2,000 transactions/month within 6 months
- Goals: reduce fees to <0.5%, validate agent cash-out UX, measure creator income uplift and flow completion

What we need from you
- Introductions to local agent networks or a pilot agent partner
- A small operational budget or stipend for agent training and liquidity
- Support validating pickup flows and agent UI/ops

What we offer
- Early access to platform and onboarding support
- Co-marketing opportunities and pilot impact reports
- Shared roadmap to scale across other townships

Next steps
- Quick intro call (30 minutes) to discuss ops, compliance and timelines
- Pilot kickoff: onboarding 20 creators in month 1 as a micro-pilot

Thanks for considering — I’ll follow up next week. Please reply with a preferred time for a short call.

Best,
[Your name]
