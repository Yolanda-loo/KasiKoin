KasiKoin — Speaker Notes (timed)

Slide 1 — Title & Hook [0:00 — 0:15]
- Stage direction: step forward, smile, show the hero image.
- Script: "Hi — imagine a young tutor in Soweto receiving stable, instant payments from learners across South Africa without a bank. That’s KasiKoin: a mobile-first, ZAR-pegged stablecoin and payments stack for township creators."
- Tip: Use a short, personal example (Lerato) to ground the problem.

Slide 2 — The Problem [0:15 — 0:35]
- Script: "Creators in the kasi face unstable income and pay 5–10% in fees to get paid. Over 20% are unbanked; many have feature phones or limited data. That means missed income, risky cash handling and exclusion from digital markets."
- Stage: point to the three icons as you say each bullet.

Slide 3 — Our Solution [0:35 — 1:00]
- Script: "KasiKoin gives creators a ZAR-pegged token on a mobile-first chain. We support QR and SMS wallets, a friendly multilingual assistant (Thando) for onboarding, milestone escrow to build trust, and NFT minting so creators can sell cultural content with provenance."
- Tip: Call out the low-fee and mobile-first design as core differentiators.

Slide 4 — Product demo (3 micro-flows) [1:00 — 1:25]
- Script: "Quick demo flows: 1) Tip: someone scans a QR code and the creator receives KASI instantly with a tiny fee. 2) Sell digital: buyer pays KASI and receives an IPFS link or optional NFT. 3) Withdraw: creator requests withdrawal, receives a one-time code and collects cash from a local agent."
- Stage: narrate an end-to-end micro-story for the tip flow to make it concrete.

Slide 5 — Impact, traction & ask [1:25 — 2:00]
- Script: "We project 500 creators and 2,000 monthly transactions in a 6-month pilot. Our aim is fees <0.5% on-platform and inclusion for feature phones and disabled users. We’re asking for $50k to run a Soweto pilot, agent partners, and mentor introductions for KYC/regulatory flows."
- Close: "KasiKoin — stabilise earnings, preserve culture, sell globally. Thank you."
