# Slide 1 — Title & Hook

KasiKoin — Stable Payments for Township Creators

ZAR-pegged, mobile-first payments that unlock income for the kasi.

Visual: portrait of a creator scanning a QR; township textile pattern border.


# Slide 2 — The Problem

1) Unstable income + 5–10% fees on remittances and platforms

2) >20% unbanked; many on feature phones or low-data plans

3) Trust gaps with cash; no easy escrow for local gigs

Visual: icons for volatility, phone, and cash


# Slide 3 — Our Solution

• ZAR-pegged KASI token on Celo (mobile-first)

• QR + SMS wallets, multilingual agent Thando

• Milestone escrow, NFT minting, local agent cash-outs

Visual: flow diagram: Buyer -> Agent/Phone -> Blockchain (KASI) -> Creator -> IPFS (content)


# Slide 4 — Product demo (3 micro-flows)

1) Tip: Scan QR → confirm → instant KASI to creator (tiny fee)

2) Sell digital: pay KASI → receive IPFS link + optional NFT

3) Withdraw: request → get OTB code → collect ZAR from agent

Visual: three phone mockups showing each flow; show small tx fee badge.


# Slide 5 — Impact, traction & ask

Impact targets

• Pilot: 500 creators, 2,000 tx/month in 6 months

• Fees: target <0.5% on-platform; instant settlement

• Inclusion: feature phones + accessibility for disabled users

Ask: $50k pilot funding, agent partners in Soweto, regulatory & KYC mentorship
